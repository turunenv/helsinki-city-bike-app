# Helsinki city bike app (Solita Dev Academy pre-assignment)

## Description

This project is my submission for the Solita Dev Academy 2023 pre-assignment. The task was to create a full-stack web application for displaying data from journeys made with city bikes in the Helsinki Capital area.

### Features

The assignment contained a list of functional requirements together with some extra features. Some of them were **recommended**, and others considered _additional_. The following is a list of those features, marked either completed :white_check_mark: or yet to be implemented :round_pushpin::

#### Data import: 
> **import data to db** :white_check_mark:, **validate the data** :white_check_mark:, **exclude journeys lasting less than 10s** :white_check_mark:, **exclude journeys with distance less than 10m** :white_check_mark:

#### Journey list view:
